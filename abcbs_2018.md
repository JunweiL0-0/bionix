We show how Nix, a cross-platform package and configuration manager, can cleanly solve a number of reproducibility headaches in bioinformatics and computational biology. 
Nix can easily create and manage isolated environments, and with our transparent and extremely lightweight extensions can also describe computational pipelines (workflows), manage their execution in HPC environments, and produce containers (Docker or Singularity images) for execution elsewhere. 
Nix is general-purpose software with a stable and growing userbase. 
We illustrate our techniques on a simple bioinformatics pipeline, and compare them with existing solutions like (Bio)conda.
